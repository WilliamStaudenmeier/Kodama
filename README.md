# Kodama with Family

I'm a big fan of Hayao Miyazaki and am looking forward to his next movie coming out in 2023.   They say that imitation is the highest form of flattery, but my goal is to capture the spirit and tell a new story.  Thank you for visiting my page. 

This is created without any libraries using HTML, CSS, and a touch of JS for the smoke.  

If you like, you can fiddle around with the animation for free on CodePen: [Kodama with Family](https://codepen.io/WilliamStaudenmeier/pen/xxzjgwd).
