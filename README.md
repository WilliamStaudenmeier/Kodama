# Kodama and Family

I'm a big fan of Hayao Miyazaki and am looking forward to his next movie coming out in 2023.   They say that imitation is the highest form of flattery, but my goal is to capture the spirit and tell a new story.  Thank you for visiting my page. 

If you like, you can fiddle around with the animation for free on CodePen: (Kodama and Family)[https://codepen.io/WilliamStaudenmeier/pen/xxzjgwd].
